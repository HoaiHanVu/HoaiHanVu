- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HoaiHanVu, I'm a biologist, geneticnist (a bit), but now I work as a Data Scientist. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, somewhere in my mind always urge me deep dive into the field of bioinfomatics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science Master program in HCM University of Sciences.
I'm best reached via email. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
